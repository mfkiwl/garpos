### Algorithm and documentation

Please see Watanabe, S., Ishikawa, T., Yokota, Y., and Nakamura, Y., (2020) https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.597532


# Requirements

* Python 3.7.3
* Packages NumPy, Scipy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are also required.
* Fortran 90 compiler (e.g., gfortran)

Environments under [Anaconda for Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is tested.


### Compilation of Fortran90-based library

For the calculation of travel time, a Fortran90-based library is needed.
For example, the library can be compiled via gfortran as,

```bash
gfortran -shared -fPIC -fopenmp -O3 -o lib_raytrace.so sub_raytrace.f90 lib_raytrace.f90
```

Path to the library should be indicated in "Settings.ini".


# Usage

When using GARPOS, you should prepare the following files.
* Initial site-parameter file (e.g., *initcfg.ini)
* Acoustic observation data csv file
* Reference sound speed data csv file
* Settings file (e.g., Settings.ini)

"bin/solveSingleEpoch.py" is a driver code. 
Two observation epochs are stored in "sample" directory as demo data.

```bash
cd sample
./demo.sh
```

or run the program manually. 

```bash
cd sample

# to solve position for each transponder (for epoch SAGA.1903)
solveSingleEpoch.py -i Settings-prep.ini -f initcfg/SAGA/SAGA.1903.kaiyo_k4-initcfg.ini -d demo_prep/SAGA
# to solve position for each transponder (for epoch SAGA.1905)
solveSingleEpoch.py -i Settings-prep.ini -f initcfg/SAGA/SAGA.1905.meiyo_m5-initcfg.ini -d demo_prep/SAGA

# to make the averaged array
makeFixCfg.py -d cfgfix --res_singles "demo_prep/SAGA/*res.dat"

# to solve in array-constraint condition (for epoch SAGA.1903)
solveSingleEpoch.py -i Settings-fix.ini -f cfgfix/SAGA/SAGA.1903.kaiyo_k4-fix.ini -d demo_res/SAGA
# to solve in array-constraint condition (for epoch SAGA.1905)
solveSingleEpoch.py -i Settings-fix.ini -f cfgfix/SAGA/SAGA.1905.meiyo_m5-fix.ini -d demo_res/SAGA
```

The following files will be created in the directory (specified with "-d" option).
* Estimated site-parameter file (*res.dat)
* Modified acoustic observation data csv file (*obs.csv)
* Model parameter list file (*m.p.dat)
* A posteriori covariance matrix file (*var.dat)


# Note

Please be aware of your storage when searching hyperparameters,

since it will create result files for all combinations of hyperparameters.
